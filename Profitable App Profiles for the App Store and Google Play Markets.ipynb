Second and third place are \"Game\" and \"Tools\", with 9.7% and 8.5% respectively. The rest of the groups all contain shares of under 5%. For `'Genres'`, \"Tools\" is the largest group with about 8.5% of apps. Second and third place are \"Entertainment\" and \"Education\", with 6.1% and 5.3% respectively. These are the only groups that contain more than 5% of apps; the rest fall under. This column is also more granular, and for now we are more interested in the big picture that `'Category'` can provide. The distribution for `'Genres'` also seems slightly more uniform than that of `'Category'`, which is a bit more right skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, in these two columns, the types of apps that tend to dominate are tools, games (most of \"family\" likely belongs here), entertainment, lifestyle, productivity, and business/finance. A good mix of apps for both practical and entertainment purposes, but among these two tables, practical seems to win out just in terms of app numbers."

All other groups are well below 5%, with \"Education\" afterwards at 3.7%.\n",

    "Based on the App Store frequency table alone, I am inclined to recommend a certain app profile (gaming and entertainment) for this particular market, but it comes of course with caveats. One is that a large number of apps in a particular genre does not necessarily imply that apps of that genre will have a large number of users. However, this is likely not a problem for iOS users. Another is that while a gaming app sounds \"tried and true,\" the field is crowded. Although a truly successful gaming app can bring in mountains of revenue, it is just as likely an app here can get lost in the crowd.\n",

    "For Google Play, practical apps fill a much larger share in comparison to entertainment apps/games.

As a workaround, I'll take the total number of user ratings as a proxy, which is represented in the `'rating_count_tot'` column.\n",

    "In this project, I analyzed data about the App Store and Google Play mobile apps with the goal of recommending an (English-speaking, free) app profile that can be profitable for both markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on information from both the App Store and Google Play datasets, a practical app could be most likely to capture users' interests and needs, thus warranting a higher number of installs and providing more opportunities for users to view in-app ads. We also want an app with which users will spend more time using, further maximizing revenue from in-app ads viewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, I have suggested two ad profiles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An intersection between the reference and travel categories, a directory app for a certain type of business or public service shows promise. Public restrooms or dog parks are two ideas. The directory can have enhanced features like maps, directions, suggestions, and user ratings and reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Judging by the popularity of some book apps like for the Bible and the Quran, as well as their supplementary apps, we can create an app for another popular, and ideally more recent book. Beyond the raw text, readers would be able interact with the text (highlight or add notes) as well as access additional features like illustrations, quizzes, and reader fora to enrich their experience and understanding."
